Ajax-enabled restful WCF Service with Visual Studio

Build a new restful WCF Service from the ground up.  I built a web application - a superhero database - where all the HTML & CSS parts are covered.

Implement the WCF Service in C# in Visual Studio and call your web service from the browser with JavaScript.

CRUD operations with custom classes and lists

Common HTTP methods

Contains the most common HTTP request methods, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

More than CRUD: Filtering, custom searches, sorting

*Sending StatusCodes*

If we're looking for a particular object but the WCF Service can't find it, it send this information back to the requesting client, i.e. sending back a "404 Not Found".
